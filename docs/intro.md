# Pyram, legacy version

**Hierarchical image segmentation with scale-set** 

Pyram is a C+ library and program to compute image segmentation. The segmentation methodology follow the scale-set paradigm described on (scale-set image analysis](https://hal.science/hal-00705364/) article. 
The segmentation result is then a hierarchy of segmentation where the end user could choose energy levels (one or multiple) to cut the hierarchy and obtain mutliple images segmentation which different level of details. It's different of superpixel or Felzenszwalb segmentation algorithms whose produce only one segmentation depending of the input segmentation parameters.
